  To build the modules from source you first have to build rack from sources as described here:  
    (link to tutorial)  

  Then clone this repository into rack's plugins folder.  
    `$ cd plugins && git clone https://github.com/phdsg/PvC`  
    
  Change directory to PvC and use make to build the plugin.  
    `$ cd PvC && make`
