# PvC Modules for VCV Rack

I'm not a coder, but VCV Rack got me interested in c++.
So, as a learning experiment i'm making some modules.
Most of them are really very simple or modifications of existing modules.
I'm also new to all this github stuff, so ...


**... expect bugs, beginner mistakes, etc.**

![Any and all feedback is welcome.](https://github.com/phdsg/PvC/issues)

## Contact

## Build

First, build the latest version of [Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack), then clone this repository inside the `plugins` folder of Rack and use `make`.
