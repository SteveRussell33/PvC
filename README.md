# [PvC Module(s)](https://phdsg.github.io/PvC) for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com)
I'm not a coder and this is my first module.
just followed the tutorial and stole some lines from fundamental/mutes.

currently requires dev version of RACK.

## MU[L]TY
a 1 x 10 Mult with mutes for each output.

## Contact

you can find me on IRC freenode #VCVRack


## Build

First build the latest version of [Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) 
Then clone this repository inside the `plugins` folder of Rack and use `make`.


## Binaries

currently only for (mostly my own) testing of my build environment. (i'm still new to all this)
the windows dll should work fine.
mac/linux i can only compile but not runtest.
