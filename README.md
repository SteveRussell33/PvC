# PvC Modules for VCVRack

__git-pages website is disabled until i find time to do it properly__

## About
this is my collection of diy modules for vcvrack.
i'm not a programmer, so most of them are simple utilities that i had fun learning to realize.

## Installation

### via VCVRack Plugin Manager
[here](https://vcvrack.com/plugins.html#pvc)

### from sources

  To build the modules from source you first have to build rack from sources as described  
  here: https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack#setting-up-your-development-environment  
  
  Then clone this repository into rack's plugins folder.  
    `$ cd plugins && git clone https://github.com/phdsg/PvC`  
    
  Change directory to PvC and use make to build the plugin.  
    `$ cd PvC && make`
