followed the tutorial and stole some lines from fundamental/mutes.

currently requires dev version of RACK.

## Build

First build the latest version of [Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) 

Then clone this repository inside the `plugins` folder of Rack and use `make`.

```
$ cd plugins
$ git clone https://github.com/modlfo/VultModules.git
$ make
```
