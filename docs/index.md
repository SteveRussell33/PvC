# PvC Modules for VCVRack
... is set of [VCVRack](https://www.vcvrack.com) modules that i created (mainly for my own use).  
I'm new to the modular synthesis world, new to programming, new to github.  
Most of the modules here are modified versions of others or just simple tools/toys i wanted to have and programmed to learn something.


**... expect bugs, beginner mistakes, etc.**


[Any and all feedback is welcome.](https://github.com/phdsg/PvC/issues)

## Contact & Help
I'm almost always online @ #VCVRack (irc.freenode.net). Other module devs are too!  
Also, the [issue tracker](https://github.com/phdsg/PvC/issues) can be used for all questions.

## Binaries
Trying this gumroad thing now, so i won't publish compiled releases here anymore
but over there for pay-what-you-think-is-fair...


## Build
To compile the modules from the source code you first need to build the latest version of [VCVRack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack).  
Then, clone this repository into the `plugins` folder of Rack and use `make`.


## Support PvC
"Buy" a copy of the modules from my [gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/kXPIO) account for 0+ bucks ;)
