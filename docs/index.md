# PvC Modules for VCVRack

<img align="right" src="../images/AllModules.png">

... is set of [VCVRack](https://www.vcvrack.com) modules created mainly for my own use.  
Most of them are modified and/or slimmified versions of others or  
just simple tools/toys i wanted to have and enjoyed learning to program them.


I'm new to the modular synthesis world, new to programming, new to github.  
**... expect bugs, beginner mistakes, etc.**

[Any and all feedback is welcome.](https://github.com/phdsg/PvC/issues)
