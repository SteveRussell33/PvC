### little backstory
this was the very first module i made.
it's basically a fork of [Fundamental/Mutes](https://github.com/VCVRack/Fundamental) (by Andrew Belt), which when it came out didn't have the multiple functionality.
i wanted a multiple with mutes, so that's how Mu\[L\]ty came to be.
initial version was 1x10 and looked like this...
