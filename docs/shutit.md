... is a 4 rack unit wide 8 channel mute switch / multiple (replaces Mu\[L\]ty)  

## Details

__1 output__ - right, red  
__1 trigger input__ - center, yellow, changes mute state (also normalized to last above)  

### Controls
__Mute Channel__ - clicking the empty field around the ports of each channel toggles mute state

## Changes
