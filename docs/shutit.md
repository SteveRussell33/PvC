# ShutIt
... is a 4 rack unit wide 8 channel mute switch / multiple

## Details
ShutIt replaces MuLty. It has 8 channels that can be individually muted using a remote trigger signal or by clicking the panel.
Each input carries the signal of the last connected input above, so this works as a flexible multiple too.

### I/O
_per channel (8)_  
__1 input__ - left, blue, normalized to last connected input above  
__1 output__ - right, red  
__1 trigger input__ - center, yellow, changes mute state when a trigger signal is received  

### Controls
__Mute Channel__ - clicking the empty field around the ports of each channel toggles mute state

## Changes
__0.5.7__ - trigger inputs normalized too, allows for more switching combinations  
__0.5.6__ - initial version
