... is a 2 rack unit wide dual stereo voltage controlled amplifier

## Details
this is basically a slimmer and modified version of the fundamental vca.
just changed it to have input/output pairs.

### I/O
_per channel (2):_  
2 inputs (i.e. L+R)  
2 outputs (i.e. L+R)  
2 control inputs (linear and exponential)

### Controls
__Gain__ controls the amplification factor.

## Changes
0.5.6 - new layout  
0.5.2 - initial version  

### little backstory
wrote this because the fundamental vca takes up so much space and i use vca's a lot.
it also makes it a little bit easier to handle stereo signals with just one control.
